# GroupGenerator
A quick little group generator.  Takes in a list of names, spits out random groups.

Ability to select either the group size or the number of groups.
No repeat tracking yet.
Currently uses a local SQL DB to be populated by user.  Stretch goals include utilizing the Canvas API to select any existing class roster.
